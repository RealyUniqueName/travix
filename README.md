# Travix - Travis CI helper for Haxe

Are you tired of setting up Travis CI for all your projects? Then `travix` is for you!

## Quickstart

To use this within one of your libs do this:

```bash
haxelib install travix    # if it's not installed already
haxelib run travix init   # this will ask you to input the necessary information
```

From there, it should be relatively straight forward.
